# Chessmania

### Introduction:

Chessmania is a game idea for a portfolio project for ALX SE, we are in the early stages of developing the game using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) as the game engine of choice, and [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) as the asset maker. This project aims at creating a 2D combination of the strategic aspect of the turn based games and the elegance of chess.
The game favors a two player format, each player has 16 pieces, each piece has some attributes and actions. And the game shall start with the elder godâ€™s blessings. For each player his turn and set of skills to choose from all after the checkmate.

**more informations about the game are coming soon**
